Design Document: Personal Finance Dashboard

1. Project Overview

Objective: Create a personal finance dashboard that allows users to manage their finances, track expenses, visualize spending trends, and gain budgeting insights. 

Target Users: Single income households trying to make ends meet. A single income leaves little room for financial buffers. Unexpected car repairs, medical bills, or home emergencies can quickly derail budgets, leading to stress and potential debt. The app aims to help with managing users personal finance, so they can live debt free, informed and less stresfull life.

Key Features:

User authentication for secure access.

CRUD operations for income and expense entries.

Dynamic charts and graphs for data visualization.

Smart spending predictions.

Bank integration via APIs (e.g., Plaid).

2. Technology Stack

Frontend:

Framework: Next.js + React.js

State Management: Context API

Styling: Tailwind CSS (chosen for its utility-first approach, enabling rapid development with minimal CSS file size compared to Bootstrap or Material-UI).

Charting Library: Recharts (for customizable, responsive visualizations).

Routing: Next.js

Type Safety: TypeScript

Backend:

Framework: Node.js with Express.js (chosen for its non-blocking I/O model, suitable for handling real-time data updates and a large developer ecosystem).

Database: PostgreSQL (SQL, for robust relational data handling with scalability and indexing support).

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Bank Integration: (Mock data for MVP) ultimetely Plaid API

DevOps:

Hosting: Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend) for cost-effective, auto-scaling solutions. Future scalability plans include AWS or GCP for enterprise-level growth.

Version Control: Git with GitHub

Testing: Jest (frontend) and Mocha/Chai (backend)

Monitoring: Sentry (error tracking) and Winston (logging)

3. Software Architecture

Frontend Architecture:

Component Hierarchy:

App

Auth

Dashboard

IncomeList

ExpenseList

AddTransactionForm

Insights

Charts

State Management:

Use Context API for managing global state, such as user data and transactions.

Create reusable hooks like useFetch and useForm for modularity.

Data Flow:

Components fetch data via API calls to the backend. Parent components pass processed data to child components for rendering.

Backend Architecture:

RESTful API Endpoints:

/auth: Handles user authentication (login, signup, logout).

/transactions: CRUD operations for income and expenses.

/insights: Provides calculated data (e.g., total spending, budgeting alerts).

/bank: Integrates with Plaid API for fetching bank data.

Database Schema:

Users:

{
  userId: String,
  name: String,
  email: String,
  passwordHash: String
}

Transactions:

{
  transactionId: String,
  userId: String,
  type: String, // "income" or "expense"
  category: String,
  amount: Number,
  date: Date
}

Add indexes on userId and date fields for improved query performance. Normalize data to reduce redundancy while considering denormalization for frequently accessed data.

Error Handling:

Middleware to handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to the frontend.

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of API endpoints.

4. Best Practices

Code Quality: Enforce Airbnb’s JavaScript/React style guide using ESLint and Prettier.

Security:

Use HTTPS for all communications.

Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.

Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

Rotate Plaid API keys regularly and use environment variables for storing secrets.

Implement rate limiting and session expiration policies.

Performance:

Optimize component rendering with React.memo and useMemo.

Use lazy loading for charts and large components.

Implement server-side pagination for transaction lists.

Testing:

Write unit tests for components and API endpoints.

Use mock data to simulate bank integrations during development.

Perform security testing against OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities.

5. Implementation Plan

Phase 1: Project Setup

Initialize a Git repository.

Set up the Next.js project using npx. √

Set up the backend project with Express.js.

Configure PostgreSQL database with schemas and indexing strategies.

Phase 2: Frontend Development

Setup:

Install dependencies (Tailwind CSS, Recharts).

Configure global state management with Context API.

Authentication:

Create signup/login pages.

Integrate JWT-based authentication.

Dashboard:

Design the dashboard layout.

Create components for transaction lists, forms, and charts.

API Integration:

Connect the frontend to the backend.

Fetch and display transactions dynamically.

Phase 3: Backend Development

Setup:

Install dependencies (Express.js, Sequelize, bcrypt for password hashing).

Set up API structure with routes and controllers.

Authentication:

Implement user authentication with JWT.

Add middleware for protected routes.

CRUD Operations:

Create routes for adding, editing, and deleting transactions.

Implement validation for transaction inputs.

Bank Integration:

Integrate the Plaid API for fetching bank data.

Handle edge cases, such as failed bank connections or outdated account data.

Phase 4: Testing

Write unit tests for React components using Jest.

Test backend endpoints with Postman and automate with Mocha/Chai.

Perform end-to-end testing using Cypress.

Simulate API failures to test error-handling robustness.

Phase 5: Deployment

Deploy the frontend to Vercel.

Deploy the backend to Render.

Configure environment variables for API keys and database credentials. Ensure sensitive data is stored securely and not exposed in source code.

Perform final testing in the production environment.

6. Additional Enhancements

Notifications: Implement email or in-app notifications for budgeting alerts.

Dark Mode: Add a toggle for light/dark themes (post-MVP).

Multi-Currency Support: Allow users to track finances in different currencies (post-MVP).

Advanced Analytics: Provide detailed insights using advanced data visualization libraries (post-MVP).
